# Image2LinearGradientCSS
A proof-of-concept to convert an image to linear-gradient CSS.

## Is this practical?
No. a 72px x 72px image is ~350-400KB of CSS.

## Example?
<a href="example/example.html">Here is an implementation of what gets output</a>. The example is based on <a href="example/example.jpg">this 72px x 72px image</a>. The actual output of the script is a file with the entire `background: ...;` CSS string.
